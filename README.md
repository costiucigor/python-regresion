In the context of programming and data analysis, regression refers to a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In Python, regression analysis can be performed using various libraries such as Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, and TensorFlow.

The most commonly used regression models include linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, and multiple regression. Linear regression is used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable, while multiple regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

Regression analysis is used in various fields such as finance, economics, marketing, and healthcare to predict outcomes based on historical data and to identify the factors that influence those outcomes. In Python, regression models are implemented using a variety of techniques such as gradient descent, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian inference.
